Since <important text = "Eternal Psycho" /> announced their gig along with <important text = "Barbara Black" /> in Caracol venue next September 10 (concert that I'll go without doubt), they haven't stop to announce new dates along Spain. Here we have a list of them that I hope it will grow during this summer:
- September 10 along with <important text = "Barbara Black" />. Madrid. Caracol venue.
 - Septiembre 18. Alicante. Babel Stage venue.
 - October 22. Santiago de Compostela. Mala Testa venue.
 - October 23 along with <important text = "Megara" />. Vigo. Master Club venue.

 <h2>Releases of the week</h2>

 <important text = "Jinjer" /> release a new single called <important text = "Mediator" /> that belongs to their next album <important text = "Wallflowers" />. A frenetic and complex song that increases our wish of listen to the new album.

A new single and video by <important text = "Edge of Paradise" /> is  also launched that will belong to their next album. Don't miss the new of the Californians called <important text = "The Unknown" />.

<important text = "Adrienne Cowan" /> brings to us the new single of <important text = "Seven Spires" />, <important text = "Lightbringer" />. A short song that makes us whet our appetite for their next <important text = "Gods of Debauchery" />.

The Danish <important text = "Volbeat" /> show us their cover of <important text = "Don't Tread on Me" /> of <important text = "Metallica" />. This song will be in the <important text = "The Metallica Blacklist" />. What do you think about it?
